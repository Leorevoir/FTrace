    Ftrace<br>analyzing executables<br>
</h4>

---

**Ftrace** is Epitech's **final project** for the `Unix Programming System` (**PSU**) module.<br>
This project was developed in the `middle` of my **second year**.<br>

---

## Description

**Ftrace** is a program that allows an `executable` to be `analyzed` during `execution`.<br>
It will allow you to generate a **call-graph**, which will explain a program's `execution flow` in **detail**.
